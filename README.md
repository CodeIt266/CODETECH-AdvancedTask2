Overview of the Project

Project: Create tool for WEB APPLICATION VULNERABILITY SCANNER

Objective:-
The Web Application Vulnerability Scanner helps find and fix SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It checks forms on web pages to see if they are secure by testing them with specific inputs. The tool looks for errors in the serverâ€™s response to detect weak points. It makes the process of finding vulnerabilities faster and more accurate. Developers can use the tool to get clear insights and fix security issues quickly. This ensures that web applications are stronger and safer from potential cyber threats.

Key Activities:-
1. Form Identification: Detect and extract all forms on the target web page for comprehensive analysis.

2. Form Analysis: Collect detailed information about form attributes, including actions, methods, input types, names, and default values.

3. Injection Testing: Perform targeted testing by injecting crafted payloads into form fields to evaluate the application's defense against SQL injection attacks.

4. Error Detection: Inspect server responses for specific error patterns that signal potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

5. Vulnerability Reporting: Generate clear, actionable reports outlining whether the application is vulnerable or secure, aiding in timely remediation.

Technologies Used:-
1. Python: Handles the scanning process and creates test payloads.

2. Requests Library: Manages HTTP GET and POST requests to interact with the target web page.

3. BeautifulSoup: Parses HTML to find and analyze web forms.

4. Session Management: Maintains session states to simulate user interactions during the scan.

5. Error Pattern Matching: Detects vulnerabilities by identifying specific error messages in server responses.

Key Insights:-
Vulnerability scanners play a crucial role in identifying security flaws in web applications, helping prevent exploitation by attackers. SQL injection is one of the most common and serious vulnerabilities, making early detection essential. Automating the scanning process improves efficiency and allows for comprehensive coverage of large applications. Detailed insights from the scanner help developers address specific vulnerabilities, leading to targeted fixes. Regular scanning and patching are vital for maintaining ongoing security, especially as web applications evolve in dynamic environments.
